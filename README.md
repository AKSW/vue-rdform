# Vue.js bindings for RDForm

[RDForm](https://github.com/simeonackermann/RDForm/) is a JavaScript library to generate HTML forms to create and edit RDF resources based on a template.

These vue bindings depend on the [SHACL branch](https://github.com/simeonackermann/RDForm/tree/feature-shacl) that is striving to use SHACL shapes as form templates.


**Notes for the future**

If we face compatibility issues with the package built we might want to use some library template, e.g.: https://github.com/prograhammer/vue-library-template
